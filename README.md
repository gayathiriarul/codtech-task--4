Spam Email Classification

This project is about identifying whether an email is spam or not spam using Machine Learning.
Python is used to build the project. The email text is first converted into numbers using CountVectorizer. Then a Naive Bayes model is trained using this data.
After training, the model checks emails and predicts whether they are spam or not. The project also allows checking new emails.
This system helps to filter unwanted emails automatically.
